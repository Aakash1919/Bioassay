					<br />
					By placing an order with us, the customer agrees to the following terms:
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>Order Cancellation</i>. To cancel an order, the customer should notify BioAssay Systems before 2:00 pm pacific time on the same day as the
					order was placed. A 10% cancellation fee will be assessed. Later notices will be treated as Returns (see below Returns and Replacement) 
					with all applicable fees. Orders which are refused at delivery will be assessed all of the applicable fees listed above - including 
					restocking, cancellation and other applicable fees.
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>Shipping</i>. Orders received before 3:00pm are usually shipped the same day. BioAssay Systems will notify customers if products they have 
					ordered are not in stock and give an approximate date of delivery. Unless otherwise agreed, all US domestic shipments will be made 
					through Fedex 2nd day service. Shipping/special handling costs and sales tax if applicable will be added to the invoice. BioAssay 
					Systems may pack multiple kits in one box, unless the customer specifically requests separate packaging. The customer shall notify 
					us of any shortages, defects or damages within 10 business days upon receiving the goods. If it is our error, we will replace the 
					missing components or products as soon as possible. If the customer shall fail to notify us of any defects within 10 days after 
					delivery of the goods, such goods shall conclusively be deemed to conform to the terms and conditions of sale and to have been 
					irrevocably accepted by the buyer.
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>Payment</i>. Our payment terms are 30 days from invoice date. All payments should be addressed to BioAssay Systems, and must be in US 
					dollars and sufficient to cover any bank and currency exchange charges. Late charges of 1.5% monthly may be added to invoices not paid 
					within the 30-day time period. Late charges must be paid before subsequent orders can be shipped.
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>Returns and Replacement</i>. We do not accept return of certain sensitive products such as products that need to be shipped on ice pads 
					or dry ice. A return authorization should be requested within 10 business days upon receiving the product. A 15% restocking and applicable 
					shipping fees will be charged on any authorized return. Request for replacement has to be approved by BioAssay Systems. The customer 
					agrees to pay the shipping and handling fee.
					<br />
					<br />

					<i>Warranties</i>. BioAssay Systems assumes no warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, beyond the scope described of its products. Our sole 
					liability is limited to replacement of product or refund of the purchase price, in our sole discretion, upon customer's satisfactory 
					proof of defect in the product. BioAssay Systems reserves the right to discontinue a product, to change specifications or modify
