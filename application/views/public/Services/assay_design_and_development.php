<span class="textbold_orange">Example of Novel Assay Design</span><br />
<ul>
<li><a href="polylactate-assay-service.html" target="_blank">Polylactate Polymer Assay</a>. BioAssay Systems has developed a proprietary ultra-sensitive assay to quantify polylactate polymers such as PLA and PLGA, in tissue samples.
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Existing Assay Modification</span><br />
In addition to developing new assays from scratch, we also have a catalogue of over 200 assay kits we can modify to meet your assay needs and requirements.
<br /><br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Common Assay Modifications</span><br />
<ul>
<li>Optimizing an assay for low volume samples for when samples are precious</li>
<li>Developing sample preparation procedures for unique samples</li>
<li>Lowering the detection range and sensitivity of an assay to quantify a target range</li>
<li>Revising assay reagents to work with specific sample types</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Examples of Assay Modification</span><br />
<ul>
<li>Peroxide Assay for Non-aqueous Samples. The QuantiChrom&trade; Peroxide Assay Kit (DIOX-250) was optimized for use in measuring organic hydroperoxides in non-aqueous samples.
</li>
<li>Lactate Assay for Measurement in Single Cells. The EnzyFluo&trade; L-Lactate Assay Kit (EFLLC-100) was optimized for use in measuring the increase of the L-Lactate concentration in single cells using fluorescent microscopy
</li>
</ul>
<br />

<i>Patrick H. Ruane, Ph.D., Director Chemistry XTENT, Inc. </i><br />
"While developing biodegradable coatings for Drug Eluting Stents I worked with Bob to develop an accurate, precise and 
sensitive assay for determining the amount of polymer remaining in tissue. It was a pleasure to work with Bob and his team, 
they are very thorough, they understand the science very well and they always deliver on time and at the right price. I would 
highly recommend anyone using BioAssay Systems services in the future."<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."<br /><br />

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />
