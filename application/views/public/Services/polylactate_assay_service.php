<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
BioAssay Systems has developed a kinetic fluorometric assay to quantify D-lactate containing polymers, such as PLA and 
PLGA in tissue samples. The assay principle is based on the hydrolysis of D-lactate containing polymers into lactate 
monomers followed by D-lactate determination using a highly sensitive and specific fluorescence method. Only L-lactate 
is naturally prevalent in animal tissue (D-lactate is typically present at only nM levels in mammals which is below the 
detection limit of the current assay); therefore, any D-lactate measured in a sample is solely derived from the polymer 
present in the sample. &mid; <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0073\u0065\u0072\u0076\u0069\u0063\u0065\u0040\u0062\u0069\u006f\u0061\u0073\u0073\u0061\u0079\u0073\u0079\u0073\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d\u003f\u0073\u0075\u0062\u006a\u0065\u0063\u0074\u003dBiopolymer Analytical Service';void 0">Inquire</a> &mid;

<span class="textbold_orange">Key Features of the Assay</span><br />
<ul/>
<li>Useful to assess remaining polymer coatings on implanted medical devices.</li>
<li>Two step process: 1) Hydrolysis of polymer present to monomers and 2) Measurement of D-lactate.</li>
<li>Accuracy and sensitivity of the assay are not affected by polymer MW, which will decrease over time during implantation.</li>
<li>The method uses D-lactate as a biomarker and since D-lactate is not found endogenously above nM concentrations, the assay is highly specific for PLA.</li>
<li>There is no requirement to remove the tissue from sample, the PLA on both the device and in the tissue are measured together.</li>
<li>Depending on the nature of the sample and polymer composition, sensitivities as low as 1 microgram are possible.</li><br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Conclusions</span><br />
Bioassay Systems has successfully performed this service to measure the degradation of polymer coatings on implanted devices 
for 3 different medical device companies.  Results from these projects were critical for two CE Mark Approvals and the FDA 
approval of two medical device Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications. </div><br />

This service includes the final preparation of samples for the assay, the hydrolysis of polymer in samples down to monomers and 
enzymatic measurement of the resultant D-lactate monomers.  The polymer weight in the sample is computed from the measured 
D-lactate concentration in the hydrolysis reaction.  The client will be issued a report summarizing the results of the 
analysis along with an Excel spreadsheet containing all of the collected data, data analysis and results.<br /><br />

<i>Patrick H. Ruane, Ph.D., Director Chemistry XTENT, Inc. </i><br />
"While developing biodegradable coatings for Drug Eluting Stents I worked with Bob to develop an accurate, precise and 
sensitive assay for determining the amount of polymer remaining in tissue. It was a pleasure to work with Bob and his team, 
they are very thorough, they understand the science very well and they always deliver on time and at the right price. I would 
highly recommend anyone using BioAssay Systems services in the future."
