<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
The solubility of a drug compound plays a significant role in absorption and is an important factor to
consider during development. Quantitative measurement of compound solubility is an ideal early test to
perform when screening for potential drug candidates.
<br />
<br />
BioAssay Systems (BAS) offers two methods for quantifying the solubility of drug compounds: filter
plate solubility testing and shake flask solubility testing. This information page details the Filter Plate
Method.

<span class="textbold_orange">Method</span><br />
In MultiScreen filter plate, the compound is mixed with a solvent of customer's choice. The plate is
gently shaken for 1.5 hours at ambient temperature (or desired temperature). The solution is vacuum
filtered. Absorbance spectrum is run on the filtrate together with the test compound standards.
Concentration of the filtrate is calculated using the slope of the standards.

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
“It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research.”<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
