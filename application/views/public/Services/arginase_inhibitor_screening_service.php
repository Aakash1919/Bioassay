<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
In order to test the suitability of BioAssay Systems Arginase Assay for screening for arginase inhibitors, we performed some 
initial experiments to determine the Km of L-arginine for a purified human arginase and the IC50 for a known arginase 
inhibitor, ABH.  We measured a K<sub>m</sub> of 3.4 ± 0.2 mM.  Using 3 mM L-arginine, we observed an IC50 = 0.14 ± 0.1 &micro;M for ABH.  
We also verified that 2 v% DMSO will not affect the assay.

<span class="textbold_orange">Results</span><br />
<i>K<sub>m</sub> of L-Arginine</i><br />
In order to determine the K<sub>m</sub> of L-arginine for Arginase I, we titrated L-arginine from 0–20 mM with 25 ng Arginase I 
and computed the rates of reaction, V (&micro;mol/min/mg), for each L-arginine concentration.  The rates of reaction were 
then plotted versus L-arginine and the Km was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc). We found the 
K<sub>m</sub> = 3.4 ± 0.2 mM.<br /><br />

<i>ABH IC50 Determination</i><br />
The IC50 determination required three steps: 1) 30 min pre-incubation of 25 ng arginase I with ABH, 2) arginase 
reaction with 3 mM L-arginine for 25 min and 3) urea concentration measurement. We titrated ABH from 0-10 &micro;M and 
computed the rate of reaction, V, for each ABH concentration.  The rates of reaction were then plotted versus 
the Log [ABH] and the IC50 was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc). We observed an IC50 = 0.14 ± 0.01 &micro;M.<br /><br />

<i>Effect of DMSO</i><br />
In order to determine if DMSO would interfere with this arginase assay, we set up four reactions: 25 ng arginase I
± 2 v% DMSO and 0 ng arginase ± 2 v% DMSO. Following a 20 min reaction and addition of the Urea Reagent, we measured 
the OD<sub>520</sub> and OD<sub>430</sub> and computed the ΔOD (ODarginase – ODno arginase) for the 2 v% DMSO and 0 v% 
DMSO reactions at each wavelength. The following table displays the results:<br /><br />

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Sample</th>
    <th>&Delta;OD520</th>
    <th>&Delta;OD430</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 v% DMSO</td>
    <td>0.3995</td>
    <td>1.4476</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 v% DMSO</td>
    <td>0.3978</td>
    <td>1.4181</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

<br />

Clearly 2 v% DMSO has no adverse effects on the assay and will not be an issue for the compound screen.<br /><br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Conclusions</span><br />
The results for the K<sub>m</sub> of L-arginine for arginase I and IC50 of ABH observed in this study agree well with numbers 
found in literature (within 3 fold).  This study also verified that 2 v% DMSO will not interfere with the assay. 
Thus, this arginase assay will be suitable for screening for arginase inhibitors.<br /><br /><br />

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
“It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research.”<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
