			<div id="T2" style="display:none">
				<p>To test for solvent interference, we titrate the solvent with the enzyme of interest and look for any increase or decrease in enzyme activity. If there is interference, we determine the solvent concentration at which interference becomes negligible. This solvent concentration is then used for the inhibitor screening tests.</p>

<span class="textbold_orange">Examples of Previous Enzyme Inhibitor Screening Services</span>

<ul style="width: 721px;">


   <li><span class="textbold_orange">Kinase Inhibitor Screening</span> BioAssay Systems has developed and validated a variety of proprietory methods for follow-up study and HTS screening of kinase inhibitors.
		<br />Assay details: <a href="/services/kinase-inhibitor-screening">html</a>&nbsp; &mid; &nbsp; <a href="/datasheet/Kinase.Inhibitor.Screening.Service.pdf" target="_blank">pdf.</a> </p><br /></li>
   <li><span class="textbold_orange">Arginase Inhibitor Assays</span> Arginase is a drug target for various diseases, such as cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial ischaemia, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 
		<br />Assay details: <a href="/services/arginase-inhibitor-screening-service">html</a>&nbsp; &mid; &nbsp; <a href="/datasheet/Arginase.Inhibitor.Screening.Service.pdf" target="_blank">pdf.</a> </p><br /></li>
    <li><span class="textbold_orange">PTP1b Inhibitor Assay.</span> Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key regulator and primary drug target for type 2 diabetes 
       and obesity. It is also involved in liver regeneration, drug-induced liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
       hepatocellular carcinoma. 
		<br />Assay details: <a href="/services/ptp1b-inhibitor-screening-service">html</a>&nbsp; &mid; &nbsp;  <a href="/datasheet/PTP1B.Inhibitor.Screening.Service.pdf" target="_blank">pdf.</a> </p><br /></li>
   <li><span class="textbold_orange">Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Assays</span>. Monoamine oxidase is involved in removing the 
       neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine from the brain. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were the first type of 
       antidepressant developed. 
		<br />Assay details: <a href="/services/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitor-screening-service">html</a>&nbsp; &mid; &nbsp;  <a href="/datasheet/MAO.Inhibitor.Screening.Service.pdf" target="_blank">pdf.</a> </p><br /></li>
   <li><span class="textbold_orange">Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Assays</span>. Acetylhydrolase is the primary cholinesterase that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine 
       and other choline esters that function as neurotransmitters. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine, thus increasing both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. 
		<br />Assay details: <a href="/services/acetylcholinesterase-inhibitor-screening-service">html</a>&nbsp; &mid; &nbsp;  <a href="/datasheet/Acetylcholinesterase.Inhibitor.Screening.Service.pdf" target="_blank">pdf.</a> </p></li><br />
	<li><span class="textbold_orange">Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Inhibitor Assays</span>. Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a family of enzymes crucial to alcohol metabolism, catalyzing the breakdown of acetaldehyde. Elevated levels of ALDHs have also been associated to certain cancer types. Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) with heightened levels of ALDHs have shown enhanced survival mechanisms leading to resistance to chemotherapy and radiation.

<span class="textbold_orange">Customer Testimonials</span><br />

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving. I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Anh-Dung Le, CEO DermaTec LLC</i><br />
"The guys at BioAssay Systems know their science! I had to develop a bioassay for our company 
and Robert was very quick to respond to keep us up to date. They are knowledgeable and very 
resourceful. They directed us to one of the bulk suppliers that could give us a really good 
deal on our active ingredient. They keep very detailed records for our research needs. I would 
recommend working with BioAssay Systems on your assay development projects!"<br /><br />
