<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
Using our <a href="/AMPK-Phosphorylation-Assay-Kit" target="_blank">EnzyFluo&trade; AMPK Phosphorylation Assay Kit</a>, we screen for modulators that increase or decrease AMPK phosphorylation status in cells. We measure the AMPK phosphorylation kinetics, EC50, and IC50 of cells treated with modulators. Testing can be run on a wide variety of cell lines.

<span class="textbold_orange">Cell Titration</span><br />
A pilot experiment was first run to determine the best cell density to plate the cells at. This example uses the cell line PANC-1. In a sterile, black 96-well plate, PANC-1 cells were plated at cell densities of 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium dosed with 25mM Metformin or control medium. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of Metformin in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 1%. Triplicate wells were incubated for 3 hours with the Metformin or control medium. The pAMPK and total protein was then quantified using the AMPK Phosphorylation Assay Kit (EAMPK-100). The pAMPK values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample. No significant difference was seen between the different cell densities.<br /><br />

<span class="textbold_orange">Phosphorylation Titration</span><br />
Before determining the time course of AMPK phosphorylation, a titration was run on the concentration of the test compound; here we use Metformin as an example.  In a sterile, black 96-well plate, PANC-1 cells were plated at a cell density of 5,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium dosed with Metformin at the following concentrations: 0, 1.6E0, 8.0E0, 4.0E+1, 2.0E+2, 1.0E+3, 5.0E+3, and 2.5E+4 &micro;M. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of Metformin in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 1%. Triplicate wells were incubated for 3 hours with the Metformin. The pAMPK and total protein was then quantified using the AMPK Phosphorylation Assay Kit (EAMPK-100). The pAMPK values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample.

<span class="textbold_orange">Phosphorylation Kinetics</span><br />
After the titration on the test compound concentration, we measure the AMPK phosphorylation kinetics for a specific dosage. Metformin will continue to serve as our example here; we measure the AMPK phosphorylation kinetics for Metformin at a concentration of 25 mM. In a sterile, black 96-well plate, PANC-1 cells were plated at a cell density of 5,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 25 mM Metformin dosed medium. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of Metformin in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 1%. Triplicate wells were incubated for 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 minutes with the Metformin. The pAMPK and total protein was then quantified using the AMPK Phosphorylation Assay Kit (EAMPK-100). The pAMPK values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample. The 0 minutes (no Metformin incubation) served as the untreated control for basal AMPK phosphorylation.

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
