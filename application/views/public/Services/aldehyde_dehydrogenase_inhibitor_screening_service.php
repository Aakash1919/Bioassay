<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
Before determining the IC50's for the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor, we performed some initial experiments to establish appropriate assay conditions. We assessed conditions for baker's yeast potassium activated ALDH.  First we titrated the enzyme using 20 mM acetaldehyde as the substrate.  From these titrations we decided to use 1.3 U/reaction of ALDH. We next titrated the solvent DMSO to determine any inhibitory effects it may have on ALDH. The K<sub>m</sub> of acetaldehyde for ALDH was then measured in the presence of the highest tolerable DMSO concentration.  Finally, the IC50 for a known ALDH inhibitor, disulfiram, was measured.  We determined the maximum DMSO concentration for the test compounds to be 100 v% (final reaction concentration of 5 v%). We determined the acetaldehyde Km to be 900 &plusmn; 92 &micro;M.  Using 900 &micro;M acetaldehyde, we observed an IC50 = 2.65 &micro;M for disulfiram.

<span class="textbold_orange">Results</span><br />
<i>ALDH Titration</i><br />
In order to determine an appropriate amount of ALDH to use for the IC50 determinations, we titrated the ALDH enzyme.  ALDH was titrated from 12 U/rxn.  The titration was performed in the presence of 5 v% DMSO using 20 mM final [acetaldehyde] as the substrate. The ALDH titration was performed in a 96 clear well plate. From the results we opted to use 1.3 U/rxn ALDH since at this concentration the reaction would remain linear for at least 30 min.

<i>K<sub>m</sub> of of Acetaldehyde</i><br />
In order to determine the Km of acetaldehyde for ALDH, we titrated acetaldehyde from 0-2 mM with 1.3 U/rxn ALDH and computed the &Delta;OD (OD<sub>30min</sub> - OD<sub>0min</sub>), which is proportional to the rate of reaction, for each acetaldehyde concentration.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus [acetaldehyde] and the K<sub>m</sub> was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  The ALDH K<sub>m</sub> determination was performed in the presence of 5 v% DMSO (final reaction concentration). We found the K<sub>m</sub> = 900 &micro;M acetaldehyde.

<i>DMSO Titration</i><br />
In order to determine tolerance for DMSO of ALDH, we ran DMSO titrations from 0-5 v% in the reaction.  For these titrations we used 1.3U ALDH per reaction.  The reaction was initiated by adding 900 &micro;M final [acetaldehyde] and was allowed to proceed for 30 min.  We then computed the &Delta;OD (OD<sub>30min</sub> - OD<sub>0min</sub>), which is proportional to the rate of reaction, for each DMSO concentration.  The &Delta;OD was then plotted versus DMSO concentration. From the result we discovered that at substrate concentration of 900 &micro;M acetaldehyde, DMSO did not affect the activity of ALDH.  For the ALDH inhibitor, we decided to move forward with 100 v% DMSO as the inhibitor solvent, which would result in a final 5 v% DMSO per reaction.

<i>Disulfiram IC50 Determination</i><br />
The IC50 determination required two steps: 1) 20 min pre-incubation of 45 &micro;L ALDH (1.3 U/rxn) with 5 &micro;L disulfiram in 100% DMSO, and 2) aldehyde dehydrogenase reaction with 900 &micro;M final [acetaldehyde] for 30 min at 25&deg;C.  We titrated disulfiram from 0-50 &micro;M and computed the &Delta;OD for each inhibitor concentration.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus the inhibitor concentration and the IC50 was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  We observed an IC50 = 2.65 &micro;M.

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
