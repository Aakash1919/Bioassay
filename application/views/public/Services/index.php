							Fast Results
						</span>
						<br />
						We pride ourselves on fast turnarounds (usually within 1 week after receiving samples) to keep your studies on schedule.

						<br />
						We manufacture all of our own assay kits and have the reagents and lab equipment needed for most research projects utilizing 
						our kits. Also, since we manufacture our own kits, we can easily optimize them to fit specific project requirements.

							Notes on Services
						</span>
						<br />
						We need a well-defined idea of what you would like made. Typically that only happens after we have a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA). 
						The NDA can be either a one-way, or more preferable, a two-way version. After the NDA has been put in place you should tell us everything 
						you want to get analyzed. This information allows us to complete the contractual work rapidly and at least cost to you.
						<br />
						<br />
						We typically carry out projects on a time and materials basis. After adequate discussion we can generate an assessment of the amount 
						of time that will be required to complete the project. You only pay for actual scientist time, plus any special raw materials such as 
						enzymes or chemicals that we do not already have in stock.

							Hear What Our Customers Say About Our Services
						</span>
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Anh-Dung Le, CEO DermaTec LLC</i>
						<br />
						"The guys at BioAssay Systems know their science! I had to develop a bioassay for our company 
						and Robert was very quick to respond to keep us up to date. They are knowledgeable and very 
						resourceful. They directed us to one of the bulk suppliers that could give us a really good 
						deal on our active ingredient. They keep very detailed records for our research needs. I would 
						recommend working with BioAssay Systems on your assay development projects!"
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i>
						<br />
						"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
						location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
						open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
						had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
						the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
						responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i>
						<br />
						"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
						in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
						in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
						is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
						<br />
						<br />
						<i>Patrick H. Ruane, Ph.D., Director Chemistry XTENT, Inc. </i>
						<br />
						"While developing biodegradable coatings for Drug Eluting Stents I worked with Bob to develop an accurate, precise and 
						sensitive assay for determining the amount of polymer remaining in tissue. It was a pleasure to work with Bob and his team, 
						they are very thorough, they understand the science very well and they always deliver on time and at the right price. I would 
						highly recommend anyone using BioAssay Systems services in the future."
