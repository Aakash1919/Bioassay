<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
Using our <a href="/NFKB-Phosphorylation-Assay-Kit" target="_blank">EnzyFluo&trade; NF&kappa;B Phosphorylation Assay Kit</a>, we screen for modulators that increase or decrease NF&kappa;B phosphorylation status in cells. We measure the NF&kappa;B phosphorylation kinetics, EC50, and IC50 of cells treated with modulators. Testing can be run on a wide variety of cell lines.

<span class="textbold_orange">Species Reactivity</span><br />
We first determine the test compound’s reactivity with different species. In this example, the species tested were human (MDA-MB-231), mouse (NIH-3T3), and rat (RBL-2H3). Here we use Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;) as an example test compound. In a sterile, black 96-well plate, MDA-MB-231, NIH-3T3, and RBL-2H3 cells were plated at a cell density of 20,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium dosed with 10 ng/mL TNF-&alpha; or no TNF-&alpha; for the baseline controls. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of 10,000 ng/mL TNF-&alpha; in dH2O. Triplicate wells were incubated for 10 minutes with the TNF-&alpha; or control medium. The pNF&kappa;B and total protein was then quantified using the NF&kappa;B Phosphorylation Assay Kit (EFNKB-100). The pNF&kappa;B values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample. The relative increase in pNF&kappa;B for the cells treated with TNF-&alpha; was 3.64:1, 2.96:1, and 0.83:1 for MDA-MB-231, NIH-3T3, and RBL-2H3 respectively. The cell line MDA-MB-231 showed the greatest reactivity to the test compound TNF-&alpha; and was chosen as the cell line for the next experiments.

<span class="textbold_orange">Phosphorylation Titration</span><br />
To determine the time course of NF&kappa;B phosphorylation, first a titration was run on the concentration of the test compound; here we use TNF-&alpha; as an example. In a sterile, black 96-well plate, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at a cell density of 20,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium dosed with TNF-&alpha; at the following concentrations: 0.0E+0, 3.8E-4, 1.5E-3, 6.1E-3, 2.4E-2, 9.8E-2, 3.9E-1, 1.6E+0, 6.3E+0, 2.5E+1, 1.0E+2, and 4.0E+2 ng/mL. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of 10,000 ng/mL TNF-&alpha; in dH2O. Triplicate wells were incubated for 20 minutes with the TNF-&alpha;. The pNF&kappa;B and total protein was then quantified using the NF&kappa;B Phosphorylation Assay Kit (ENFKB-100). The pNF&kappa;B values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample.

<span class="textbold_orange">Phosphorylation Kinetics</span><br />
After the titration on the test compound concentration, we measure the NF&kappa;B phosphorylation kinetics for a specific dosage. TNF-&alpha; will continue to serve as our example here; we measure the NF&kappa;B phosphorylation kinetics for TNF-&alpha; at a concentration of 100 ng/mL. In a sterile, black 96-well plate, PANC-1 cells were plated at a cell density of 20,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100 ng/mL TNF-&alpha; dosed medium. The dosed culture medium was prepared from a stock solution of 10,000 ng/mL TNF-&alpha; in dH2O. Triplicate wells were incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 120 minutes with the TNF-&alpha. The pNF&kappa;B and total protein was then quantified using the NF&kappa;B Phosphorylation Assay Kit (ENFKB-100). The pNF&kappa;B values were normalized to the total protein content of the sample. The 0 minutes (no TNF-&alpha; incubation) served as the untreated control for basal NF&kappa;B phosphorylation.

<span class="textbold_orange">Hear What Our Customers Say About Our Services</span><br /><br />
<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
