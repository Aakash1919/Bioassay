<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
In order to develop an Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor screening assay kit, we performed some initial experiments to establish appropriate assay conditions. We assessed conditions for Acetylcholinesterase from electric eel. First we titrated the AChE using 1 mM Acetylthiocholine iodide as the substrate and DTNB as the chromagen.  From this titration we decided to use 0.0035 Units/reaction AChE for assay development and IC50 determinations. The Km of Acetylthiocholine iodide for AChE was then determined. We next titrated DMSO to determine the highest concentration that would be tolerated by AChE. Finally, the IC50’s for two known Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, Donepezil and Physostigmine, were measured. We determined the Km to be 0.425 mM and the maximum DMSO concentration to be 100 v%.  Using 0.425 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, we observed an IC50 = 48.3 nM for Donepezil and an IC50 = 46.7 nM for Physostigmine when each inhibitor was dissolved in 20v% DMSO.

<span class="textbold_orange">Results</span><br />
<i>AChE Titration</i><br />
In order to determine an appropriate amount of AChE to use for the inhibitor screening assay and for IC50 determinations, we titrated AChE. The reaction was performed using 1 mM Acetylthiocholine Iodide and 0.4 mM DTNB dissolved in Assay Buffer pH 7.6.  From these results we opted to use 0.0035 U/rxn AChE.  At this concentration the reaction would remain linear for at least 10 minutes and the &Delta;OD should be significant (>0.2) even at the Acetylthiocholine Iodide K<sub>m</sub>.
<br /><br />

<i>K<sub>m</sub> of of Acetylthiocholine Iodide</i><br />
In order to determine the K<sub>m</sub> of Acetylthiocholine iodide for Acetylcholinesterase (electric eel), we titrated acetylthiocholine iodide from 0-4.3 mM with 0.0035 U/rxn AChE and computed &Delta;OD (OD<sub>10min</sub> - OD<sub>0min</sub>), which is proportional to the rate of reaction, for acetylthiocholine iodide.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus acetylthiocholine iodide concentration and the K<sub>m</sub> was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  We found the K<sub>m</sub> = 0.425 mM for Acetylthiocholine Iodide.

<i>DMSO Titration</i><br />
In order to determine tolerance for DMSO of Acetylcholinesterase, we ran a DMSO titration (from 0-100 v% for the 5 &micro;L of variable compound in a 200 &micro;L reaction). For this titration we used 0.0035 U/rxn AChE.  The reaction was initiated by adding Acetylthiocholine Iodide, DTNB, and Assay buffer pH 7.6 (Final concentrations 0.425 mM Acetylthiocholine Iodide and 0.3 mM DTNB) and was allowed to proceed for 10 min.  We then computed the &Delta;OD (OD<sub>10min</sub> - OD<sub>0min</sub>), which is proportional to the rate of reaction, for each DMSO concentration.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus DMSO concentration.  From these results we discovered that that we can use up to 100 v% DMSO if needed, but decided to move forward with 20 v% DMSO for IC50 determinations.

<i>Donepezil IC50 Determination</i><br />
The IC50 determination required two steps: 1) 15 min pre-incubation of 45 &micro;L AChE (78 U/L) with 5 &micro;L Donepezil (in 20 v% DMSO), and 2) acetylcholinesterase reaction with 150 &micro;L Working reagent containing acetylthiocholine iodide, DTNB, and assay buffer for 10 min (0.425 mM [Acetylthiocholine Iodide] and 0.31 mM [DTNB] final).  We titrated Donepezil from 0-25 &micro;M and computed the &Delta;OD for each Donepezil concentration.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus the Log [Donepezil] and the IC50 was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  We observed an IC50 = 48.3 nM.

<i>Physostigmine IC50 Determination</i><br />
The IC50 determination required two steps: 1) 15 min pre-incubation of 45 &micro;L AChE (78 U/L) with 5 &micro;L Physostigmine (in 20 v% DMSO), and 2) acetylcholinesterase reaction with 150 &micro;L Working reagent containing acetylthiocholine iodide, DTNB, and assay buffer for 10 min (0.425 mM [Acetylthiocholine Iodide] and 0.31 mM [DTNB] final).  We titrated Physostigmine from 0-25 &micro;M and computed the &Delta;OD for each Physostigmine concentration.  The &Delta;OD's were then plotted versus the Log [Physostigmine] and the IC50 was computed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.).  We observed an IC50 = 46.7 nM.

"It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
