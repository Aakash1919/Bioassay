<span class="textbold_orange">Summary</span><br />
Toxicity is a crucial factor to test when evaluating test compounds as potential drug candidates. In most
cases, test compounds should not be detrimental to the health of the cells they are treating. In order to
evaluate the toxicity of test compounds, BioAssay Systems offers three different methods of measuring
in vitro cell viability.
<br />
<br />
After treatment with test compounds, cell viability can be evaluated by the following methods:
<br />
1. The levels of intracellular ATP as an indicator of healthy cells;
<br />
2. Levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) excreted into the cell media from damaged cells as an
indicator of toxicity;
<br />
3. Cellular reduction capacity using either a fluorescent or colorimetric dye as a measure of viability.

<span class="textbold_orange">Method</span><br />
The cell line of interest is plated at the specified cell density and the respective positive controls,
negative controls, and treatments are added to the media. After incubation with the treatments for the
specified time, the respective reagent for the desired test method is added to the wells. The wells are
then read via luminescence, fluorescence, or absorbance either immediately or after further incubation
depending on the test method.
<br />
Compounds can be evaluated for dose response, where the cytotoxicity is evaluated at various
concentrations for a set treatment duration, or for time response, where cytotoxicity of a specific
concentration is measured at time points throughout the course of treatment.

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
“It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research.”<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
