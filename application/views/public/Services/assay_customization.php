BioAssay Systems offers customization of any of our assays if a customer should have special requirements. 
<br>
<br>
Our scientists have over 50 years of extensive hands-on experience in assay development and execution. During the past 
decades, we have successfully helped our customers achieve their goals. Since we manufacture our own assay kits, we can easily optimize and/or modify our kits for custom applications.

<i>Anh-Dung Le, CEO DermaTec LLC</i>
"The guys at BioAssay Systems know their science! I had to develop a bioassay for our company 
and Robert was very quick to respond to keep us up to date. They are knowledgeable and very 
resourceful. They directed us to one of the bulk suppliers that could give us a really good 
deal on our active ingredient. They keep very detailed records for our research needs. I would 
recommend working with BioAssay Systems on your assay development projects!"<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."<br /><br /></div>
