		<ul>
		<li><span class="italic" style="color: #d6500f;">ERK Phosphorylation Status</span>
		<br />
		The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Stimulation by mitogens eventually leads to phosphorylation of ERK1 (T202/Y204) and ERK2 (T185/Y187). The MAPK/ERK cascade presents many interesting drug targets for the development of cancer therapies.

		<br />

		<li><span class="italic" style="color: #d6500f;">AMPK Phosphorylation Status</span>
		<br />
		The 5-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of intracellular energy balance. AMPK is activated in response to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, which can be caused by a number of factors such as muscle contraction, starvation, or hypoxia. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation on Thr-172 within the catalytic domain. AMP binding results in a 2 to 5-fold increase in AMPK activity compared to the basal level.

		<br />
		<li><span class="italic" style="color: #d6500f;">NF&kappa;B Phosphorylation Status</span>
		<br />
		Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF&kappa;B) is a transcription factor that plays a central role in many physiological processes (e.g. inflammation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis). NF&kappa;B is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&alpha;. Phosphorylation of p65/RelA at Ser-536 results in decreased nuclear export and enhanced p65/RelA-dependent transcription.

location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving. I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research."<br /><br />

<i>Anh-Dung Le, CEO DermaTec LLC</i><br />
"The guys at BioAssay Systems know their science! I had to develop a bioassay for our company 
and Robert was very quick to respond to keep us up to date. They are knowledgeable and very 
resourceful. They directed us to one of the bulk suppliers that could give us a really good 
deal on our active ingredient. They keep very detailed records for our research needs. I would 
recommend working with BioAssay Systems on your assay development projects!"<br /><br />
