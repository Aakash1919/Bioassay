   <span class="italic" style="color: #d6500f;">1. IMAP Kinase Assay</span>: this fluorescence polarization assay is based on the specific binding of the kinase reaction product, a fluorescent labeled phosphopeptide, to metal-nanoparticles, thus slowing down the rotation of the peptide in solution.

   <br /><br />Typical assay optimization steps include enzyme (Figure A) and substrate titrations, interference by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Z' factor determination. For screening kinase inhibitors, the inhibitor is usually incubated with the kinase for 10 min prior to addition of ATP and substrate. Z' factors of >0.8 are often observed in these assays.

   <span class="italic" style="color: #d6500f;">2. EKIN Kinase Assay</span>: our proprietary, homogeneous, microplate-based EKIN kinase assay involves incubating the kinase with a single working reagent. During the kinase reaction, ATP is converted to ADP. The produced ADP is enzymatically converted to ATP and pyruvate, which is quantified using a fluorimetric (530nm/590nm) assay method.<br />

<i>Edward T. Wei, Chief Scientific Officer, Orinda Pharma, Inc.</i><br />
“It is a pleasure working together with BioAssay Systems.  I brought samples to their Hayward 
location and received the results in less than 24 hr.  The discussion with Robert Z was courteous, 
open, and with a depth of knowledge.  Robert has a PhD from Stanford.  Also, Frank Huang, the CEO, 
had sufficient scientific curiosity to try out our cleanser and provide feedback!  This is beyond 
the call of customer relations.  BioAssay Systems is a company with a lot of expertise and a friendly, 
responsive approach to problem solving.  I will enthusiastically continue to work with them to carry out our research.”<br /><br />

<i>Paul Abbyad, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Santa Clara University</i><br />
"I would like to show my appreciation to the Bioassay Systems service team. We are developing an assay to measure the change 
in lactate concentration of single cell samples using fluorescent microscopy.  The BioAssay Systems team was quite helpful 
in assisting us to optimize their fluorescent L-Lactate assay kit for our unique experimental set-up. The BioAssay Systems team 
is always friendly and knowledgeable. We know that we can rely on them for fast and professional service."
